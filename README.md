First things first! 

When pillars of light on the waters is glassed,
As blent in one glow seem the shine and the stream,
but wave after wave through the glory is passed,
merely catches and flies as it catches the beam.
So honors but mirror on mortals their light - 
not the man but the place that he passes is bright.
